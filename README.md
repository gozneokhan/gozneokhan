## SeWoong Kim, Backend - Developer
"Hello, I am a developer who aims to grow steadily by recording and improving with a goal of 1% growth per day."
* With a goal of 1% growth per day, I utilize a technical blog and GitHub to document what I learn and my experiences. Through studying algorithms, I aim to enhance my logical reasoning skills and accumulate knowledge.
* "When faced with unexpected situations, I demonstrate adaptability by effectively addressing them on the spot. Drawing upon previous experiences and learning, I analyze the problem and devise creative and efficient solutions. Additionally, I gather input from others, collaborate with team members, and work together to achieve common goals."
* "I systematically handle tasks and carefully understand user requirements to ensure smooth progress. Additionally, when starting a task, I coordinate schedules by distributing the workload according to specifications through meetings."
